What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Sets up staging and work areas.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is for completed files to be committed to the repository and the working directory is for files being updated and not ready.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
After changing a file, add it to the staging area with git add, then compare to the repository with git diff --staged, if correct then commit with git commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Helpful in making an experimental change while keeping the master in tact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
You can see that if you do not start a new branch, making a change to a previous node will not be reachable and will not show in git log.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Adds known additions, removes known removals from both branches.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Automatic merging reduces work where there's no ambiguity.
