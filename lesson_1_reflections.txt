How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    It gave a small subset of the code lines to analyse.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    It allows me to restore an older file when the newer one fails in some way and leading in the wrong direction.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    It is good to save versions when they are changed and in a runnable state as well as after a large change with a long pause.  Saving automatically creates too many non-useful versions.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git files are often interdependent, Google Docs are not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To find where a bug originated by checking successive versions and then comparing.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    It gives you the security of knowing you can always backtrack if something goes wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To manage all source code.
