When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there are multiple contributors or you want to share.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To be aware of the changes and ready to take them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a clone on GitHub.  This allows you to make changes without changing the original.  A clone is a copy of a GitHub repository or a duplicate of a local repository on your local PC .  A branch on your local repository allows you to make changes without affecting what's current.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
There will be fewer commits to merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Collaborators would have to agree to allow only one contributor to make changes at a time.  This is easier in that no merging would be needed but less productive since collaborators would have to wait their turn.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When collaborating with others requiring their input.
